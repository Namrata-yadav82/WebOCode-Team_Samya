                        Every human being has the Right to Health but there are people who are deprived of this Right.
                        LGBTQ
                        community is one of them.
                        There are a plethora of issues that affect the health of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender,
                        and
                        intersex (LGBTI) persons, many of which are issues relating to human rights. Around the world
                        and in
                        all societies, LGBTI persons face discrimination and marginalization which puts them at risk of
                        not
                        being able to attain the highest attainable standard of health.
                    </div>
                    <div class="para2">
                        Most societies are structured around
                        two binary genders, male and female, and only one ‘normal’ sexual orientation, heterosexual.
                        Medical
                        practitioners, health care workers, policy-makers, and educators often fail to talk about, or
                        even
                        consider, those who fall outside of this norm. LGBTI persons are those who are not heterosexual
                        (sexual orientation) or those whose identity is not gender-conforming by societal norms (gender
                        identity). When the issues of sexual orientation or gender identity are
                        considered, often little or no thought is given to how the right to health of these individuals
                        could be better protected. This invisibility, and associated isolation and marginalization, can
                        have
                        tragic consequences for the health and wellbeing of many members of LGBTI communities. They have
                        been subjected to direct violations, whereby their physical or mental health is compromised
                        because
                        of their actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. Lesbians, gays, bisexuals,
                        transgender, and intersex persons have been attacked, arrested, tortured, killed, sentenced to
                        death, committed to medical or psychiatric institutions, and treated with ‘aversion therapy’
                        including electroshock therapy or forced rape. Intersex individuals, especially those with
                        visibly
                        atypical anatomy, have been subjected to surgery against their will, for example, to ‘correct’
                        their
                        ‘ambiguous genitalia. LGBTI persons are also indirectly victimized through failures to recognize
                        and
                        consider this diverse group as healthcare recipients with specific needs resulting in a denial
                        of
                        access to the full enjoyment of their right to the highest attainable standard of health. LGBTI
                        persons experience frequent human rights violations based solely upon their LGBTI status, which
                        has
                        a major impact on the health of LGBTI persons.

        This situation is an unacceptable affront to human
        dignity, particularly given the startling statistics that have been well known for many years: LGBTI
        people, especially LGBTI youth, are highly susceptible to poor health and health risks. Suicide
        attempts amongst LGBTI youth, in general, are reportedly 3-7 times higher than for heterosexual
        youth. For these young people, family or social pressure to conform to the heterosexual norm makes
        them highly susceptible to mental health problems and places their personal safety at risk. The rate
        of suicide and suicide attempts amongst LGBTI adults is also higher than in the heterosexual
        community. Studies have also shown that ‘sexual minorities have a higher rate of other mental health
        problems including depression, bipolar disorder, panic attacks, as well as substance abuse including
        tobacco, alcohol and drug addictions and other ‘unhealthy behaviors’ such as high-risk/unsafe sex,
        and higher infection rates for HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. For example, it has
        been shown lesbian woman are more likely to smoke, abuse alcohol, weigh more, and suffer stress,
        than heterosexual women, placing them in a higher risk category for heart disease, stroke, cervical
        and other forms of cancer. Also, lesbians usually have fewer pregnancies and live births than their
        heterosexual counterparts which results in greater hormone exposure and increases their risk of
        breast, uterine and ovarian cancer.
