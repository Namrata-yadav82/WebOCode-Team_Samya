How Your website justifies the theme you have selected?
The name of our website is “Samya”, Samya is a Sanskrit word that means “Equality” or “Justice”. The idea behind giving this name to our website is our topic which is “Right to Health” based on the theme “Healthcare” one of the provided themes by the competition Organizers of WebOCode. The unique thing about our website is that here we have talked about the “Right to Health for LGBTI People”. We have mentioned the discrimination and Health Challenges they face in the health system because of their sexual orientation and gender identity around the world. We have talked about the Yogyakarta Principle. The provisions in the Yogyakarta Principles provide guidance on how international human rights law can be applied in the specific context of respecting, protecting, and promoting the right to health for LGBTI persons. We have added some quick stats we got from the net.
