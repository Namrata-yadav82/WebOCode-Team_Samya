Right To Healthcare

There is nothing new or special about the right to life and security of the
person, the right to freedom from discrimination. These and other rights are
universal … enshrined in international law but denied to many of our fellow
human beings simply because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

— United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay, 2012

Right to the Highest Attainable Standard of Health
“international human rights law affirms that all persons, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity, 
are entitled to the full enjoyment of all human rights, [and] that the application of existing human rights entitlements should take account of the specific situations and experiences of people of diverse sexual orientations and gender identities.”
-Yogyakarta Principles
 
Every human being has the Right to Health but there are people who are deprived of this Right. 
LGBTQ community is one of them.
There are a plethora of issues that affect the health of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, 
and intersex (LGBTI) persons, many of which are issues relating to human rights. Around the world 
and in all societies, LGBTI persons face discrimination and marginalization which puts 
them at risk of not being able to attain the highest attainable standard of health. 
Most societies are structured around two binary genders, male and female, and only one ‘normal’ 
sexual orientation, heterosexual. Medical practitioners, health care workers, policy-makers, 
and educators often fail to talk about, or even consider, those who fall outside of this norm. 
LGBTI persons are those who are not heterosexual (sexual orientation) or those whose identity is not 
gender-conforming by societal norms (gender identity). LGBTI refers to gay, lesbian, or bisexual 
persons (sexual orientation) and transgender or intersex persons (gender identity). 
When the issues of sexual orientation or gender identity are considered, 
often little or no thought is given to how the right to health of these individuals could be better protected.
This invisibility, and associated isolation and marginalization, can have tragic consequences for the health 
and wellbeing of many members of LGBTI communities. They have been subjected to direct violations, 
whereby their physical or mental health is compromised because of their actual or perceived sexual orientation 
or gender identity. Lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgender, and intersex persons have been attacked, arrested, 
tortured, killed, sentenced to death, committed to medical or psychiatric institutions, and treated with 
‘aversion therapy’ including electroshock therapy or forced rape. Intersex individuals, especially those 
with visibly atypical anatomy, have been subjected to surgery against their will, for example, to ‘correct’ 
their ‘ambiguous genitalia. LGBTI persons are also indirectly victimized through failures to recognize and 
consider this diverse group as healthcare recipients with specific needs resulting in a denial of access to 
the full enjoyment of their right to the highest attainable standard of health. LGBTI persons experience 
frequent human rights violations based solely upon their LGBTI status, which has a major impact on the health 
of LGBTI persons. This situation is an unacceptable affront to human dignity, particularly given the startling 
statistics that have been well known for many years: LGBTI people, especially LGBTI youth, are highly 
susceptible to poor health and health risks. Suicide attempts amongst LGBTI youth, in general, 
are reportedly 3-7 times higher than for heterosexual youth. For these young people, family or social pressure 
to conform to the heterosexual norm makes them highly susceptible to mental health problems and places 
their personal safety at risk. The rate of suicide and suicide attempts amongst LGBTI adults is also higher 
than in the heterosexual community. Studies have also shown that ‘sexual minorities have a higher rate of 
other mental health problems including depression, bipolar disorder, panic attacks, as well as substance 
abuse including tobacco, alcohol and drug addictions and other ‘unhealthy behaviors’ such as high-risk/unsafe 
sex, and higher infection rates for HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. For example, it has been 
shown lesbian woman are more likely to smoke, abuse alcohol, weigh more, and suffer stress, than heterosexual 
women, placing them in a higher risk category for heart disease, stroke, cervical and other forms of cancer. 
Also, lesbians usually have fewer pregnancies and live births than their heterosexual counterparts which 
results in greater hormone exposure and increases their risk of breast, uterine and ovarian cancer.
