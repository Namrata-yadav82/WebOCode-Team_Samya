Right To Healthcare

There is nothing new or special about the right to life and security of the
person, the right to freedom from discrimination. These and other rights are
universal … enshrined in international law but denied to many of our fellow
human beings simply because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

— United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay, 2012
