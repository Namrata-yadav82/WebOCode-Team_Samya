Right To Healthcare

There is nothing new or special about the right to life and security of the
person, the right to freedom from discrimination. These and other rights are
universal … enshrined in international law but denied to many of our fellow
human beings simply because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

— United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay, 2012

Right to the Highest Attainable Standard of Health
“International human rights law affirms that all persons, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity, 
are entitled to the full enjoyment of all human rights, [and] that the application of existing human rights entitlements should take account of the specific situations and experiences of people of diverse sexual orientations and gender identities.”
-Yogyakarta Principles
 
Every human being has the Right to Health but there are people who are deprived of this Right. The LGBTI 
community is one of them. Around the world and in all societies, LGBTI persons face discrimination and 
marginalization which puts them at risk of not being able to attain the highest attainable standard of heal 
Most societies are structured around two binary genders, male and female, and only one ‘normal’ sexual 
orientation, heterosexual. Medical practitioners, health care workers, policy-makers, and educators often 
fail to talk about, or even consider, those who fall outside of this norm. LGBTI persons are those who are 
not heterosexual (sexual orientation) or those whose identity is not gender-conforming by societal norms. 
When the issues of sexual orientation or gender identity are considered, often little or no thought is given 
to how the right to health of these individuals could be better protected. This invisibility, and associated 
isolation and marginalization, can have tragic consequences for the health and wellbeing of many members of 
LGBTI communities. They have been subjected to direct violations. Lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgender, and 
intersex persons have been attacked, arrested, tortured, killed, sentenced to death, committed to medical or 
psychiatric institutions, and treated with ‘aversion therapy’ including electroshock therapy or forced rape.
Intersex individuals, especially those with visibly atypical anatomy, have been subjected to surgery against 
their will. LGBTI persons are also indirectly victimized through failures to recognize and consider this 
diverse group as healthcare recipients with specific needs resulting in a denial of access to the full 
enjoyment of their right to the highest attainable standard of health.
LGBTI persons experience frequent human rights violations based solely upon their LGBTI status, which has a 
major impact on the health of LGBTI persons. LGBTI people, especially LGBTI youth, are highly susceptible to 
 health and health risks. Suicide attempts amongst LGBTI youth, in general, are reportedly 3-7 times higher 
 than for heterosexual youth. For these young people, family or social pressure to conform to the heterosexual 
 norm makes them highly susceptible to mental health problems and places their personal safety at risk. 
 The rate of suicide and suicide attempts amongst LGBTI adults is also higher than in the heterosexual 
 community. Studies have also shown that ‘sexual minorities have a higher rate of other mental health problems 
 including depression, bipolar disorder, panic attacks, as well as substance abuse including tobacco, alcohol 
 and drug addictions and other ‘unhealthy behaviors’ such as high-risk/unsafe sex, and higher infection rates 
 for HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. For example, it has been shown lesbian woman are more 
 likely to smoke, abuse alcohol, weigh more, and suffer stress, than heterosexual women, placing them in a 
 higher risk category for heart disease, stroke, cervical and other forms of cancer. Also, lesbians usually 
 have fewer pregnancies and live births than their heterosexual counterparts which results in greater hormone 
 exposure and increases their risk of breast, uterine and ovarian cancer. not being able to attain the highest 
 attainable standard of health.

DISCRIMINATION
LGBTI persons experience multiple forms and manifestations of discrimination that affect the health of LGBTI persons.
Health Challenges resulting from Heterosexism
One of the health challenges faced by the LGBTI community is that they can’t talk to doctors about who they have sex with, they won’t get the information they need. Providers don’t necessarily know the sexual orientation of their patients. This can prevent them from asking certain questions, probing for certain risk behaviors. Another potential barrier to health care is “coming out.
How violation of Human rights of LGBTI takes place
A psychiatrist provides treatment to an LGBTI person with electric shock or hormone therapy without consent. Health benefits and insurances are not made available to LGBTI individuals, because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, including funds for body modifications. A transgendered person is denied services or insurance coverage for services such as hormone replacement therapy and gender reassignment surgery. LGBTI communities are denied access to services to prevent HIV. Young people are denied information about HIV and AIDS, safer sex, and condoms, as well as about sexual behaviors such as homosexuality.
Failure of Health System and Its Causes
A national health system fails to provide anti-retroviral treatment to LGBTI people while making it accessible to others. Perceived LGBTI persons are treated with stigma and judgmental attitudes in the health system and therefore are not providing equal levels of health. Because of stigma in the health system, LGBTI individuals do not feel comfortable accessing health care facilities. Men who have sex with men (MSM) and other marginalized populations are regularly left out of national health and budget plans, thereby ensuring that services are not funded and available. No information in the school curriculum about LGBTI health/sexual health education for future protection against sexually transmitted illnesses such as HIV and AIDS. Sexual education should be broadened to include specific information about the health of LGBTI persons. Secondary schooling does not provide information on LGBTI health issues, nor the equivalent of the preventative health education that is provided on heterosexual health. Secondary schools do not uphold LGBTI health education in their curriculum. As a result, LGBTI youth are not exposed to crucial information in regards to their health, which is necessary as a tool for their future growth and health.
LGBTI Health Education
Provide LGBTI health education is an important aspect of the Right to Health for LGBTI individuals in many countries, educational materials that address sexual orientation and gender identity issues, or even acknowledge the existence of LGBTI concerns, are banned from schools. In many countries around the world, the hetero-norm is reinforced through withholding education about sexual and gender diversity, and risking the health of young LGBTI people in the process.
