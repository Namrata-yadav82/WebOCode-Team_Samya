                    Every human being has the Right to Health but there are people who are deprived of this Right. LGBTQ community is one of them.
                    Around the world and in all societies, LGBTI persons face discrimination and marginalization which puts them at risk of not being able to attain the highest attainable standard of heal
                    Most societies are structured around two binary genders, male and female, and only one ‘normal’ sexual orientation, heterosexual. Medical practitioners, health care workers, policy-makers, and educators often fail to talk about, or even consider, those who fall outside of this norm. LGBTI persons are those who are not heterosexual (sexual orientation) or those whose identity is not gender-conforming by societal norms. When the issues of sexual orientation or gender identity are considered, often little or no thought is given to how the right to health of these individuals could be better protected. This invisibility, and associated isolation and marginalization, can have tragic consequences for the health and wellbeing of many members of LGBTI communities. They have been subjected to direct violations. Lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgender, and intersex persons have been attacked, arrested, tortured, killed, sentenced to death, committed to medical or psychiatric institutions, and treated with ‘aversion therapy’ including electroshock therapy or forced rape. Intersex individuals, especially those with visibly atypical anatomy, have been subjected to surgery against their will. LGBTI persons are also indirectly victimized through failures to recognize and consider this diverse group as healthcare recipients with specific needs resulting in a denial of access to the full enjoyment of their right to the highest attainable standard of health.

        LGBTI persons experience frequent human rights violations based solely upon their LGBTI status, which has a major impact on the health of LGBTI persons. LGBTI people, especially LGBTI youth, are highly susceptible to poor health and health risks. Suicide attempts amongst LGBTI youth, in general, are reportedly 3-7 times higher than for heterosexual youth. For these young people, family or social pressure to conform to the heterosexual norm makes them highly susceptible to mental health problems and places their personal safety at risk. The rate of suicide and suicide attempts amongst LGBTI adults is also higher than in the heterosexual community. Studies have also shown that ‘sexual minorities have a higher rate of other mental health problems including depression, bipolar disorder, panic attacks, as well as substance abuse including tobacco, alcohol and drug addictions and other ‘unhealthy behaviors’ such as high-risk/unsafe sex, and higher infection rates for HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. For example, it has been shown lesbian woman are more likely to smoke, abuse alcohol, weigh more, and suffer stress, than heterosexual women, placing them in a higher risk category for heart disease, stroke, cervical and other forms of cancer. Also, lesbians usually have fewer pregnancies and live births than their heterosexual counterparts which results in greater hormone exposure and increases their risk of breast, uterine and ovarian cancer.

                    LGBTI persons experience multiple forms and manifestations of discrimination that affects the health of LGBTI persons.
                    <h2>Health Challenges resulting from Heterosexism</h2>
                    One of the health challenges faced by the LGBTI community is that they can’t talk to 
                    doctors about who they have sex with, they won’t get the information they need. 
                    Providers don’t necessarily know the sexual orientation of their patients. 
                    This can prevent them from asking certain questions, probing for certain risk behaviors. 
                    Another potential barrier to health care is “coming out.

                <div>
                    <h2>How violation of Human rights of LGBTQ takes place:</h2>
                    A psychiatrist provides “treatment” to an LGBTI person with electric shock or hormone therapy
                    without consent. Health benefits and insurances are not made available to LGBTI individuals, because
                    of their sexual orientation or gender identity, including funds for body modifications. A
                    transgendered person is denied services or insurance coverage for services such as hormone
                    replacement therapy and gender reassignment surgery. LGBTI communities are denied access to services
                    to prevent HIV. Young people are denied information about HIV and AIDS, safer sex, and condoms, as
                    well as about sexual behaviors such as homosexuality.
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Failure of Health System and its cause:</h2>
                    A national health system fails to provide anti-retroviral treatment to LGBTI people while making it
                    accessible to others. Perceived LGBTI persons are treated with stigma and judgmental attitudes in
                    the health system and therefore are not providing equal levels of health. Because of stigma in the
                    health system, LGBTI individuals do not feel comfortable accessing health care facilities. Men who
                    have sex with men (MSM) and other marginalized populations are regularly left out of national health
                    and budget plans, thereby ensuring that services are not funded and available.
                    No information in the school curriculum about LGBTI health/sexual health education for future
                    protection against sexually transmitted illnesses such as HIV and AIDS. Sexual education should be
                    broadened to include specific information about the health of LGBTI persons. Secondary schooling
                    does not provide information on LGBTI health issues, nor the equivalent of the preventative health
                    education that is provided on heterosexual health. Secondary schools do not uphold LGBTI health
                    education in their curriculum. As a result, LGBTI youth are not exposed to crucial information in
                    regards to their health, which is necessary as a tool for their future growth and health.

                    in many countries, educational materials that address sexual orientation and gender identity issues,
                    or even acknowledge the existence of LGBTI concerns, are banned from schools. In many countries
                    around the world, the hetero-norm is reinforced through withholding education about sexual and
                    gender diversity, and risking the health of young LGBTI people in the process.
